## Extended version
### Assignment rules
Compile the registration form specifying the names of each component of your group (3 people) and the address of your GitHub repository. Make sure that your repository is public and without any limitations for cloning, or our system will not collect your homework. As soon as you keep the same repository address during the semester, you can use any personal account to push new content.
Each Wednesday at the end of the lecture, you will get your weekly homework and the deadline for the submission is the following Monday at 11.59pm. Late submissions after midnight are accepted, but the mark will have a reduction of 0.25 points every 3 hours (in discrete time).
Our Homework Bot will collect your assignment from GitHub and it will use the time of the last `git push` to adjust your grade. We are well aware of the power `git` when it comes to rewrite the commit history -- as such, any `git push --force` with fake date will invalidate your submission (don't worry, we know how to deal with this :)
To make easier the correction you have to keep one repository for all the semester assignments, and we encourage you to use the same folder name used in the official homework repository (typically 'nn-Name').

### Peer review
When our Homework Bot has collect all the assignments, you will get a private message in Slack with two exercises to review. You have 48 hours to complete this job, and note that this is an individual task and you are not required to share this activity with your team. The grading system is the standard EPFL scale (1 to 6) and you must be as unbiased as possible, as the same reviews are assigned to multiple people and double checked by the TAs. Important: doing the review is an assignment itself!

### Grade
After we collected all the result from the peer reviews, TAs will make a final evaluation of the assignment and your team will receive the final grade.

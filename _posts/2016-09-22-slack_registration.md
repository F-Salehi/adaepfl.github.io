title: Slack registrations

We are gradually sending you invitations to our Slack organization, because unfortunately we could not mass-invite everyone in one shot (as Slack believes we are spamming them...)
For this reason, we have enabled free registrations if you have a `@epfl.ch` email account. Point your browser to [https://adaepfl.slack.com/signup](https://adaepfl.slack.com/signup) and you are good to go!

We recommend you to install the Slack application both on your computer and smartphone, so that you won't miss any notification.
